# OS Scheduler Simulation

A simple simulation of an OS scheduler using different scheduling algorithms including: Highest Priority First (non-preemptive), Shortest Remaining Time Next and Round Robin. It also allocates memory using the First-Fit algorithm or the Buddy System Allocation algorithm.

## How To Run
- Type `make build` to make the required files
- Type `make run` to run them
- You can also manually run by typing `./process_generator.out`
- You can type `make clean` to remove all `.out` files
- You can also simply type `make all` to clean and build at the same time
